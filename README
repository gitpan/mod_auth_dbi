To link Apache with the DBI authentication module, you'll need to use
the Makefile.tmpl file in this directory, or make changes to your copy.

You'll also need to add this line to the Configuration file:
Module dbi_auth_module mod_auth_dbi.o

Fetch and install Devel::embed from CPAN.

Follow the Apache install docs from there.

see comments in mod_auth_dbi.c too.

Let me (dougm@osf.org) know how it goes...
